This was a for-fun design project during some of Fall 2024 but mostly during my 2024 Winter break. The mechanical design is pretty much there. I would like to change the power system as the massive battery is overkill and makes the robot more bulky than it needs to be. Ideally, I would like to design a PCB and make everything integrate cleanly with the mechanical design. 

Maybe I'll find some more time and motivation to revamp this thing. Maybe give it some eyes and allow it to talk??
