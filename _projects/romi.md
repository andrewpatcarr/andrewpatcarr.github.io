## Documentation

As part of our project, we created a website for documentation of every aspect of the project.

# Here's a quick overview


## The Project - Romi

Throughout the quarter in ME-405, we worked on labs that built, wired, and programmed our mini-car robot, Romi, in different ways for different tasks.


We parameterized our motors, implemented task-based non-blocking programming, implemented an IR line sensor,
and worked with an IMU. All of these labs were building towards our term project/challenge. We needed to complete
the following course by hitting each checkpoint, detecting the wall and making our way back to the start pad.
