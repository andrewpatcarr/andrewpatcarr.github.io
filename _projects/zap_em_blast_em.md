## Project Overview:

Zap'Em Blast'Em Robots is an interactive game inspired by Rock'Em Sock'Em Robots, developed as part of the Mechanical Control System Design course at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. Designed by graduate students in the Mechanical Engineering program, the project showcases a fully integrated system combining mechanical, electrical, and software components.

Over the course of a 10-week quarter, our team designed a complete mechanical design, fully integrated electronics, and task-based software design.

Our mechanical design focuses on game-specific mechanics, aesthetics and manufacturability. We had multiple actuators and sensors that needed to be implemented in tight spaces while minimizes structural size.

Our electrical design focused on integration and support for our significant amount of game features. It was our first time designing a PCB so lots of time was spent learning design techniques and iterating based on feedback from our instructor **Charlie Refvem**. 

Our software design was designed a task-based system. Each task uses a finite state machine implemented with "pseudo-object-oriented" C structs. This architecture makes our code base scalable and organized.
